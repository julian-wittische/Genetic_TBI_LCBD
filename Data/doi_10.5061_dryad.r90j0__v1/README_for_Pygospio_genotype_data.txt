The 'Pygospio_genotype_data.txt' file contains microsatellite genotype data of 765 P. elegans individuals used in the study. 
The data is in the form of 2-digit Genepop file used in the analyses.
There is 2 to 3 temporal samples from 7 different collection sites (the samples are separated with the word 'Pop').

After the title line are the names of the 8 microsatellite loci. 
A same identifier is used for all individuals within a sample (e.g. FIA2008 for all individuals collected from the Finnish Ängsö site in 2008).
The genotype data for each individual is written in one line after the identifier (8 loci per individual).
